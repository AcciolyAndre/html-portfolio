<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  With 12 years of experience as an air traffic flow management specialist, I
  have developed excellent communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking
  skills. Now, I am excited to transition my career to front-end development,
  where I can apply these skills to create engaging and user-friendly web
  experiences.
</p>

<p>
  I have extensive expertise in managing complex systems and coordinating with
  multiple stakeholders to ensure safe and efficient air traffic flow. My
  experience in developing and implementing new policies and procedures has
  given me valuable experience in project management and strategic planning.
</p>

<p>
  My passion for web development led me to take courses in HTML, CSS, and
  JavaScript, and I have completed personal projects to gain practical
  experience. Although I have yet to work as a front-end developer, my
  meticulous attention to detail, ability to troubleshoot and analyze complex
  data, and collaborative approach make me confident in my ability to excel in
  this field.

<p>
  I hold a Bachelor's degree in Aeronautical and am excited to bring my skills
  and experience to a new career in front-end development.
